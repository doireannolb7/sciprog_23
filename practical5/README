Three programs to be compiled:

1. To compile read.f90:
gfortran -o read read.f90 
This program allows user to supply an annswer anf for it to be read from the screen

2. To compile fibonacci.f90:
gfortran -o fibonacci fibonacci.f90
This program allows the user to supply a number, and the program will calculate the fibonacci series up to that number

3. To compile arctan.f90:
gfortran -o arctan arctan.f90
This program allows the suer to input a value for delta (precision value)
Two formulae are used to calculate the hyperbolic tangent 
The difference between both methods at different values of delta will be printed
