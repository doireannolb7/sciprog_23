This code multiplies matrix A by matrix B to give Matrix C

Two files are used here: main.f90 and mult.f90
main.f90 is used to define the matrices
mult.f90 is where the matrix multipilication occurs 

A Makefile is also used to allow for complilation of both files simultaneously
This is useful when chnages are made to a file so re-compilation can be carried out once only

To compile:
make -f Makefilef

To run:
 ./matmultf

Running program shows matrices A,B,C
