For this practical one program is to be complied:

gfortran -o finde finde.f90
To run, use: /finde e

The user gives a number between 1 and 15 which is used as the polynomial order
e is calculated ad compared to its true value
The program prints the value of e

The result becomes less accurate after 13th term as integer acnnot be used to represent higher polynomial orders in 4 bytes
