This program takes the input of a file and checks to see if the matrix in the file is a magic square or not
For a magic square, the sum of each row, column and both diagonals is the same number
The converse is true for a matrix which is not a magic square

To compile:
gfortran -o main main.f90

To run:
./main 

User will be prompted to choose a file
To try running using a magic square type matrix use:
magic_square.txt

To try running using a non magic square type matrix use:
not_magic_square.txt

The program will display the sum of the rows, columns and both diagonals 
It will also say if the square is magic or not 


(Unfortunately I did not succeed in having this program work as it should. I was unable to get the sum of both diagonals and I recognise that 
there are more errors in my code also as my row and column sums using magic_square.txt did not all add to the same number. I was unable to spend 
enough time fixing my code due to tine constraints)
